# ðŸ¤– Telegram Robots Proxy

A lightweight PHP script that acts as a **proxy layer** between your client application and the official **Telegram Bot API**.  
It receives incoming requests, processes them, and forwards them to the Telegram servers â€” useful for adding custom logging, security layers, or bypassing access restrictions.
